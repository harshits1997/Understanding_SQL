# Understanding_SQL
This PPT is for Basic SQL to Intermediate SQL prepared by me 

I would like to share the presentation that we have recently delivered on the topic of SQL. The presentation is aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of SQL concepts, ranging from the basics to advanced topics.

Attached to this email, you will find the PowerPoint presentation file titled "Understanding_SQL_Concepts.pptx". This presentation covers essential SQL concepts, including RDBMS fundamentals, SQL commands, basic and intermediate SQL operations, aggregating data, and advanced SQL techniques. I believe this presentation will serve as a valuable resource for anyone looking to enhance their SQL knowledge.
